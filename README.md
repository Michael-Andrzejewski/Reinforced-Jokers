# Stacking Jokers

By **Soareverix**.

A Balatro mod that keeps **Showman** permanently active and lets duplicate Jokers **stack** instead of taking a new slot. Pick up a Joker you already own and it folds into the copy you have, bumping a stack counter, so you can run a **3x Photograph** or a **2x Chad**. A stacked Joker applies its effect once per stack.

Built on commission for [Bean](https://www.youtube.com/@BeanBalatro).

## How it works

- **Always-on Showman:** duplicates always show up in the shop and packs.
- **Combine on pickup:** acquiring a Joker you already own removes the new card and increments a stack count on the existing one (with a little juice for feedback). A duplicate can be bought even at full slots; the button reads "Reinforce".
- **Stacking = effect x stack:** when a stacked Joker scores, its effect is scaled by the stack. Additive fields (mult, chips, money, retriggers) multiply by N; multiplier fields (x_mult, x_chips) raise to the power N. So 3x Photograph is X2^3 = **X8**, and 2x Chad retriggers 2 x 2 = **4** times.
- **Side-effect Jokers** (create cards, level hands, change hands/discards, etc.) repeat their effect N times. **Money** Jokers pay N times. See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for the full per-Joker breakdown.
- The stack count shows on the Joker's tooltip as "Reinforced xN".

All behaviours can be toggled in the mod config.

## Requirements

- [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) (1.0.0-beta or newer).

## Install

```
cd %AppData%\Balatro\Mods
git clone https://github.com/Michael-Andrzejewski/Stacking-Jokers.git StackingJokers
```

## Known limitations

- **Ceremonial Dagger / Madness** destroy one Joker per blind by design; their accumulated mult / x_mult scales with the stack.
- **Probabilistic Jokers** (Misprint, Business Card, Bloodstone, etc.) match in expected value but with different variance than N separate copies.
- The incoming duplicate's edition and eternal/perishable/rental stickers are dropped; the kept copy wins. Combining is by Joker type, ignoring edition.
- Self-scaling Jokers (Green Joker, Ride the Bus, etc.) apply the correct scaled total; the number printed on the card shows the base counter.

A full audit of every vanilla Joker is in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md).
